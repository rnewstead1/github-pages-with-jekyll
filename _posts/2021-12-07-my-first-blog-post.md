Yay, this is my first blog post!

 Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. Does it come in black? Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.

 I'm not wearing hockey pads. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.

 Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.

 My anger outweights my guilt. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.
